### Narrative Description

### In this selection of projects, the following qualities stand out:

* ### Breadth & Depth: Ranging from fast, focused academic research to long-term transformational change in mission-critical aerospace systems. 

* ### Methodological Rigor: Use of structured frameworks (mixed methods, case studies, organizational psychology models), tools (Miro, Confluence, simulation), and human-centered approaches. 

* ### Skill Growth: Strong growth in leadership & facilitation, cross-role stakeholder alignment, psychological safety, human factors, research methods, communication under complexity. 

* ### Delivery & Outcomes: Evidence of measurable improvements—team dynamics, safety mindset, compliance, customer satisfaction, clarity in process alignment.

### 

### **Analysis & Insights**

* ### Strength in Sustained Transformation: The dominance of the Agile Culture Reset project shows that I perform best in long-term, systemic change roles — not just quick wins but embedding culture and process over time. 

* ### High Value on Human-Centered Work: My efforts skew toward facilitation, stakeholder work, research. This suggests my core differentiators are human systems insight, empathy, coaching, and translating complex data into meaningful interventions. 

* ### Balanced Analytical & Operational Skills: While I spend less time in compliance/process and tool implementation than in research or stakeholder work, I maintain competence. This balance supports roles where both people and systems matter. 

* ### Opportunities for Growth: To deepen further, I see room to increase work in process optimization / compliance implementation, and perhaps increase visibility of my written outputs (reports, publications). These can amplify impact beyond immediate project teams.
